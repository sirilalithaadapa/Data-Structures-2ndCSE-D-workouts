# Linked List

A linked list is an ordered collection of finite, homogenous data elements called nodes
where the linear order is maintained by means of links or pointers.

## Linked List vs Arrays
* Like arrays, linked list is a linear data structure
* Unlike arrays, linked list have dynamic size
* Unlike arrays, random access is not allowed
* Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at the contiguous location
the elements are linked using pointers

## Types of linked list
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Circular Linked List


## Operations
* **Insertion** of a node into a list
* **Deletion** of a node from a list
* **Copy** a linked list to make a duplicates
* **Merging** two linkedlists into a larger list
* **Traversing** 

## Insertion of a node
* Get a new node from memory block
* Start from the header node
* Manage links to
	* Insert at front
	* Insert at end
	* Insert at any position

## Deletion of a node
* Delete from the beginning
* Delete from the middle
* Delete from end
