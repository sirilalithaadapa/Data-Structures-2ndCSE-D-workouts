Procedure:

Algorithmic steps:

1) Consider an unsorted list.
2) Identify the first element as key/pivot element
3) Start comparing the key with rightmost element.
4) As long as there is bigger element towards right, keep coming left(Move R to L)
5) When a smaller element is found, perform swap.
6) Start comparing the key with leftmost element.
7) As long as there is a smaller element towards left, keep coming right (Move L to R)
8) When a bigger element is found, perform swap.
9) repeat the steps 4 to 8 till the key element reaches its own/appropriate place.
10) Further, divide the list into 2 sublists (left & right sublists based on the key 
    position).
11) Again apply the steps 2 to 10 on both left & right sublists till the list is sorted.
